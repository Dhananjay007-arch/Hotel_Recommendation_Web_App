# Hotel_Recommendation_Web_App
In this project, I have created a website that recommends hotel based on the preferred city and price. 100 hotels have been included in this website. Each hotel page page displays information like hotel name, location, facilities, price, etc. User must signup into the system to avail the booking option.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<h4>Front-End Development - HTML, CSS, JS</h4>
<h4>Back-End Programming - PHP</h4>
<h4>Database - MySQL</h4>
<h4>Localhost Server - XAMPP</h4>

<h2>Install the XAMPP Server</h2>
https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
Download Xampp from the above link. Once installed, start the Apache and MySQL module.

<h2>Create a Database</h2>
Type "localhost/phpmyadmin/" in your browser and create a new database "hotel". There is an import option in this database. Import the "hotel.sql" file. You will se 4 tables, admin, users, hotel and history.

<h2>Running the website</h2>
In your local machine, paste this folder in the "htdocs" directory of your "Xampp" folder. Then go on the browser and type localhost/<folder_name>/hotel/welcome.php. In this way you can see the website on localhost.
